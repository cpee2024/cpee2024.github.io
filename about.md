# Aim

Conference on Computational Problems of Electrical Engineering is a conference with over 20 years of tradition.
The aim of the conference is sharing new findings in a broad topic of computational sciences originated from 
(but not limited to) electrical engineering.

# Scope

The scope of the conference will be focused on the machine learning and
industrial applications as well as on the development and application of modern
methods and tools for analysis and design of complex electrical and coupled
systems, effective approaches and methods for signal processing, analysis and
design of electrical and electronic circuits and electromagnetic devices.

We invite presentations on: machine learning tools and their application in
electrical engineering, signal and image processing, biological and medical
engineering, diagnostics and prediction, application of optimization methods to
the design of electrical systems by using field and circuit theory tools and
signal processing, development of effective numerical methods of the analysis
of the electromagnetic fields by applying finite element and boundary elements
in electromagnetic and coupled problems, industrial application of scientific
application in wide area of electrical end electronic engineering.
