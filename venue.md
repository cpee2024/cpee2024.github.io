# Venue 

The conference will be held in the village of Stara Morava located away from the hustle and bustle of the city and
civilization. Which means you don't have to make a trip to the end of the world to join the CPEE2024 conference.
The conference center is located in the Śnieżnik Massif, just 7 km from Czarna Góra, less than 120 km from
Wrocław, 300 km from Poznań, Kraków or Žilina, and a little further from Warsaw. The resort also has a Wellness &
SPA area, which you will be able to use after plenary and poster sessions.
